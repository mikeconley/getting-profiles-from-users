# For users running Firefox 48.0.2

Hello! If you're reading this, then you're experiencing a performance problem in Firefox 48.0.2, and I've asked you for more information. The instructions on this page will show you how to get the information that I need to determine what is going wrong with Firefox.

You might want to open up these instructions in a separate browser so that you can keep them open while you get the data from Firefox (which will need to be shut down at a few points).

## First step - back up your bookmarks, history, etc (your "profile")

I don't expect anything to go wrong, but just in case it does, it's always good to back up your Firefox so that you can recover in the worst case scenario.

[The instructions here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles#w_locate-your-profile-folder) will guide you through backing up your data.

In case things go wrong, [here are the instructions for restoring your data](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles#w_restoring-a-profile-backup).

## Next, get a copy of our Nightly builds

"Nightly" is a build of Firefox that we create every day, and it has special instrumentation that will let us get the information we need.

[You can get a copy of Nightly here](https://nightly.mozilla.org/).

## Shut down Firefox

Next, make sure you quit Firefox. You need to do this, as you cannot run Nightly and Firefox at the same time if its using the same profile data (your bookmarks, history, etc).

## Start Nightly

Nightly is going to have a slightly different icon (a little blue planet), and it might open up an extra tab when it starts talking about what Nightly is. You can safely ignore it.

## Install the Gecko Profiler Add-on

The Gecko Profiler Add-on is the tool that we're going to use to get the data we need. [You can download the add-on from this link](https://github.com/bgirard/Gecko-Profiler-Addon/blob/master/geckoprofiler-signed.xpi?raw=true).

Save that file to a place on your computer you can easily find later.

Next, in your URL bar, type in:

    about:addons

and press Enter.

In the page that appears, click on the "Extensions" item on the left.

There should be a gear icon near the "Search all add-ons" text input in the top right. Click on the gear, and choose "Install Add-on From File" from the menu. Now browse to the Gecko Profiler Add-on file that you downloaded earlier, and choose it. This should install the add-on.

If all goes well, there should be a little icon in your toolbar that looks like this:

## A quick explanation on what the Gecko Profiler Add-on does

Briefly, the Gecko Profiler Add-on acts a bit like a flight recorder for an airplane. There's a recording mechanism that will record what Firefox is doing at any given time. There's limited space on the recording "tape", so if it runs out, just like a flight recorder, it'll begin recording over the start of the tape and loop over.

So what we need to do is get Firefox to perform poorly, and then to dump the "performance profile" before the useful data starts being recorded over. In my estimation, that's within about 15 seconds.

## Now, reproduce the problem

The next step is to try to get yourself into that bad performance state. Browse like you would normally until Firefox starts acting up.

Once Firefox starts acting up, wait a few seconds to make sure enough data gets into the recording, and then click on the planet icon in your toolbar. In the panel that comes up, click on "Analyze".

This will open a tab that will allow you to view the profile you just gathered.

## Sending me the profile

In the bottom left side of the profile viewer, there's a button that says "Share". If you click on it, a warning dialog comes up telling you what you're about to share. If you agree, click on "Upload". The profile will upload, and when it's done, a link should be available for you to share. Right click on that link, copy it to your clipboard, and send it to me at mconley at mozilla dot com.

Alternatively, if you don't want to share your profile publicly, you can choose "Save to Local File". Save the profile somewhere on your disk you can find it again, and then send it to me via email at mconley at mozilla dot com.

## A video demonstration

[If you'd like to see a video demonstration of me doing the above, here's an older video of me doing that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGBs0BQsoQg)

## Remove the add-on

Next, in your URL bar, type in:

    about:addons

into your URL bar, and choose the "Extensions" item on the left.

In the list of extensions, for Gecko Profiler Add-on, choose "Remove". This should remove the add-on from your profile.

You should now feel free to shut down Nightly.

## Cleaning up

You should feel free to uninstall Nightly now. Feel free to email me at mconley at mozilla dot com if you need more instruction on how to do that.
